	 what is a field? 
	 A field is the data element that represents a value for an object. This is defined 
	 as data type and name.
	 
	  What is a constructor?
	  A constructor is an initialization method to initialize objects or fields. If the
	  compiler doesn't see any constructors, it will automatically create one that does
	  not take any parameters, and doesn't change the value of the fields. Constructors
	  are identified in that they do not declare a return type.
	  
	  What does override mean?
	  Creating a method with the same method signature (method name / parameter list) as
	  the parent method will result in that method being called instead of the method 
	  defined in the parent class.
	  
	  Specifying the parent class of the method you are declaring?
	  Done with the use of "extends" after the local class name and the method or the 
	  declared parent. e.g public class lesson extends student.
	  
	  Is there a parent class?
	  The default parent class when none has been declared is always java.lang.Object
	  To get class: objectName.getClass(); aka subclass or derived class
	  To get parent: objectName.getSuperClass(); aka superclass or baseclass
	  
	  How do you overload a constructor?
	  Overloading constructors, is declaring constructors with different parameter
	  lists for all the potential different options on the class.
	  
	  What is the difference between overload and override?
	  Overload is locally creating the same constructor or method name with different 
	  data elements?
	  Overriding creating a local version of a parent method with the same method name
	  and parameter list.
	  
	  How do you create an array?
	  type[] name = {e1,e2,e3,e4};
